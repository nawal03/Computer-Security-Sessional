# Computer Security Coursework

This repository contains my practical assignments and explorations from the Computer Security sessional course, focusing on core cryptographic algorithms and real-world security threats.

##  Cryptography

- **AES**: Built the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm from scratch.
- **RSA**: Implemented the RSA public-key encryption scheme, including key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- **Diffie-Hellman**: Simulated secure key exchange using the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

## Security Threats & Analysis

- **Phishing Framework Exploration**:  
  Used **Gophish** to analyze phishing framework features and campaign behavior. A detailed report was prepared on phishing tactics.

- **Malware Attacks**:  
  Implemented and simulated basic **virus** and **worm** to understand their propagation and payload mechanisms.
